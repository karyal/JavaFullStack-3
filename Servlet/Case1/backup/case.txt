Scenario
A taxi company would like to provide an online service for customers to book a trip and for taxi drivers to check their upcoming trips. Data needs to be stored in an external file – either a text file or database. The following data, at least, would need to be stored and be retrievable - customer data (name, address, email, telephone number, payment method) and trip information (pick up and drop off address, and pickup time and date). Furthermore, you will need to store driver information (name and license plate). Each trip must be assigned to exactly one driver (and trips allocated to a driver must not overlap).

Customers who are not registered yet need to register - providing their name, address, phone number, email address and method of payment. A registered customer should be able to book a trip, ie. provide the pickup address and time as well as the drop off address – preferably via a graphical user interface. Customers should also be able to view their trips and cancel them if needed.

All these operations are only possible after a customer signs in (which means they must be registered). Each new trip booking must be confirmed by the taxi company administrator who must also assign a driver to the booking. Only one driver must be assigned to each confirmed booking. After logging in, taxi drivers must be able to view a list of their upcoming trips.
